# number-to-word

The initial idea was to make a program to **convert numeral to alphabetical representation of number** and use it in ERP module for  invoicing. The result was a simple console app in *python* and in my mother tongue - Polish.

Later, during my internship in **[Newland Technology](https://newland.by)**, I was asked to write function in *plpgsql* to convert numbers to word representation, So I wrote a few versions of this code in *python* and *plpgsql* and in **Polish, Russian and English.**

For now most advanced is *number-to-word-ru.sql* with posibility to process numbers with decimal value, but I will keep improving other functions.
